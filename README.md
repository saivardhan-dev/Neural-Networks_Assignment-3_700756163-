Neural-Networks-Assignment-3

Question - 1

Employee Class:
**Employee class has a class variable number_of_employee to count the instances of employees.
The constructor initializes instance variables (name, family, salary, department) and increments the number_of_employee.
The static method calculate_average_salary calculates the average salary of a list of employees.
**
FulltimeEmployee Class:
**FulltimeEmployee class inherits from the Employee class using super().__init__(...).**

Instances and Function Calls:
**Instances of both Employee and FulltimeEmployee classes are created.
The calculate_average_salary function is called with the list of employees.
Results are printed, including average salary, total employees, and the department of the fulltime employee.
This code provides a basic structure for managing employee data, calculating average salary, and handling full-time employees as a specialized case of employees.

Question - 2
**This code uses the NumPy library to create a random vector of 20 numbers uniformly distributed between 1 and 20. It then reshapes this vector into a 4x5 matrix. The code identifies the maximum value in each row of the matrix and replaces those values with 0. Finally, it prints the original random vector and the modified 4x5 matrix. The purpose of setting the maximum values to 0 is not explicitly stated in the code.**
